## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document specifies the requirements of CampusShare, a web application that lets Beihang University students lend and borrow equipment. It is written for the development team, the instructor, and the peer-review teams. It describes what the system must do, which requirements the current application already meets, and which it does not.

### 1.2 Scope

**CampusShare** lets a student list equipment they own, lets other students browse and request it, and supports the whole loan: approval, payment status, deposit handling, return, damage assessment and disputes, ratings, messaging, and notifications. An administrator role handles moderation.

**Out of scope (unless the team decides otherwise, see section 6):** real online payment processing, delivery or logistics, and users outside Beihang University.

### 1.3 Definitions

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Owner (lender) | A registered user who has listed an item |
| Borrower | A registered user who has requested an item |
| Listing | An equipment record created by an owner |
| Request / rental | A borrowing request, which becomes a rental once approved |
| Deposit | An amount set by the owner and held against damage or loss |
| Late fee | A charge for returning an item after the agreed end date |
| Dispute | A borrower's objection to a damage report, raised within 48 hours |
| Administrator | A user whose email is on the configured allowlist |
| SRS | Software Requirements Specification |

### 1.5 Conventions

- Requirements use the word **shall**. Each has a unique ID.
- **ID format:** `FR-<area>-<nn>` for functional, `SEC-<nn>` for security, `NFR-<area>-<nn>` for non-functional.
- **Priority** (MoSCoW): **M** = Must, **S** = Should, **C** = Could.
- **Status** of the current application:
  - **Done**: works as specified, confirmed by an automated test, by running the code, or by reading it (see section 5.2).
  - **Partial**: works in part, or works with a known limitation.
  - **Missing**: not implemented.
  - **To verify**: not yet confirmed.
  - **Under study**: the team is assessing whether it is feasible.
- **Verification** method planned: **T** = test, **D** = demonstration, **I** = inspection of code or documents.

### 1.6 Overview

Section 2 describes the product and its users. Section 3 lists the requirements. Section 4 shows the main process flows. Section 5 explains how requirements are verified. Section 6 lists decisions for the team. The appendix records the gaps found in the first prototype and what became of them.

## 2. Overall description

### 2.1 Product perspective

CampusShare is a standalone web application. Users access it through a browser. The server stores all data in a single SQLite database file and uploaded photos on local disk. Email is sent through an SMTP service configured at deployment.

    W -->|SMTP, configured per deployment| E[Email service]
```

### 2.2 Product functions (summary)

1. Register with email confirmation, log in, log out, and reset a password
2. Create, edit, and delete equipment listings with photos, priced per day or per hour
3. Browse, search, and filter listings
4. Request equipment for a date range or time range, with a live cost estimate
5. Approve or reject requests (owner)
6. Record payment, deposit, return, late fees, damage, and disputes
7. Review owners and borrowers after completed rentals
8. Message other students, including from an item or a request, and see unread counts
9. Receive in-app notifications, optional email notifications, and return reminders
10. Administer the platform: remove listings, suspend accounts, resolve damage disputes

### 2.3 User classes

CampusShare has one account type with a role field. Full detail is in `user-roles-and-permissions.md`.

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| Visitor | Not logged in. Can view the home and browse pages and register or log in |
| Registered user | Verified, logged-in student. Can list items, request items, message, and review |
| Owner | Registered user who owns a given listing. Can approve, reject, complete rentals, and handle deposits and damage for that listing |
| Borrower | Registered user who made a given request. Can pay, dispute damage reports, and review |
| Administrator | Provisioned only from the `CAMPUSSHARE_ADMIN_EMAILS` allowlist. Can remove listings, suspend non-administrator accounts, and resolve damage disputes |

### 2.4 Operating environment

- Python 3.9 or newer with Flask 3.1.3, Flask-WTF 1.2.2, and qrcode with Pillow (listed in `requirements.txt`)
- SQLite database file `campusshare.db`, created on first run
- Developed on Windows with Python 3.14; a macOS run was reported; the automated tests also passed on Linux with Python 3.12 in the reviewer's run
- The development server binds to `127.0.0.1` only. Deployment requires a production server behind an HTTPS proxy (see SEC-12)

### 2.5 Constraints

- Registration is limited to Beihang University email addresses (`@buaa.edu.cn`).
- The project is developed by a student team within one semester. Deadlines: SRS in Week 7, design in Week 11, product launch in Week 16.
- No real payment gateway is available to the team. Payments are simulated.

### 2.6 Assumptions and dependencies

- Users meet in person to hand over and return items. The system records the loan but does not move the item.
- A working SMTP account is needed for verification, password-reset, and notification emails.
- Return reminders and database backups need an operating-system scheduler. Scripts are provided for Windows.

| SEC-02 | The system shall require passwords of 8 to 128 characters that are not on a list of common passwords. | M | Done | T |
| SEC-03 | The system shall store passwords only as salted hashes. | M | Done | I |
| SEC-04 | The system shall read its secret key from configuration outside the source code and refuse to start without it. | M | Done | I |
| SEC-05 | The system shall protect every state-changing request against cross-site request forgery. | M | Done | T |
| SEC-06 | The system shall end sessions after 30 minutes of inactivity and shall set the cookie flags HttpOnly and SameSite, and Secure when served over HTTPS. | M | Done | T |
| SEC-07 | The system shall block further login attempts for 15 minutes after 5 failed attempts for the same account. | M | Done | T |
| SEC-08 | The system shall check on the server that the acting user owns the listing or request, and that the request is in a valid state, before any owner-only or borrower-only action. | M | Done | T |
| SEC-09 | The system shall validate all input on the server (types, ranges, dates, lengths) and respond with a clear, styled error page instead of failing. | M | Partial | T |
| SEC-10 | The system shall use parameterized database queries for all data access. | M | Done | I |
| SEC-11 | The system shall make password-reset links single-use and shall not reveal whether an email is registered. | M | Partial | T |
| SEC-12 | The system shall bind the development server to the local machine only and shall be served over HTTPS in deployment. | M | Partial | I |
| SEC-13 | The system shall show other users only a name, not an email address or student ID. | M | Done | T |
| SEC-14 | The system shall not write secrets, tokens, or reset links to logs or consoles. | M | Done | T |
| SEC-15 | The system shall escape user-supplied text on every page to prevent script injection. | M | Done | I |
| SEC-16 | The system shall log security-relevant events (failed logins, approvals, deposit changes, damage decisions, dispute decisions) without recording credentials or personal text. | S | Done | T |

*SEC-01 note:* the logic is tested. The student ID itself is still not checked against any source (section 6).
*SEC-09 note:* many validations are tested (dates, amounts, files, passwords), but completeness for every field has not been demonstrated.
*SEC-11 note:* the reset response is the same for known and unknown emails (tested). Links are not invalidated after use.
*SEC-12 note:* the server binds to `127.0.0.1`, and production mode requires a trusted HTTPS proxy, redirects HTTP, and sets HSTS. No HTTPS deployment exists yet.
*SEC-15 note:* confirmed by inspection: templates use automatic escaping, and no template uses the `safe` filter.

### 3.4 Non-functional requirements

| ID | Requirement | Pri | Status | Ver |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-PERF-01 | The system shall return browse and search results within 2 seconds for 95% of requests with 1,000 listings and 50 simultaneous users. *(proposed target, to confirm)* | S | Done | T |
| NFR-USE-01 | The system shall show validation messages beside the form fields, keep submitted values after an error, and prevent selecting past dates in date pickers. | S | Done | T |
| NFR-USE-02 | The system shall show consistently styled error pages instead of plain text messages. | S | Done | T |
| NFR-USE-03 | The system shall be usable on screens from 360 px wide. | S | To verify | D |
| NFR-REL-01 | The system shall enforce database referential integrity so that no record refers to a deleted record. | M | Done | T |
| NFR-REL-02 | The system shall back up the database at least once a day. | S | Partial | I |
| NFR-MNT-01 | The project shall provide a `requirements.txt` listing all dependencies. | M | Done | I |
| NFR-MNT-02 | The project shall split the application into modules and include automated tests for the request lifecycle and access control. | S | Partial | I |
| NFR-POR-01 | The system shall run on macOS, Windows, and Linux with Python 3. | S | Done | D |

*NFR-PERF-01 note:* the benchmark `performance_test.py` uses an in-process test client. The developer measured p95 of about 0.88 seconds on Windows. The reviewer's run on Linux measured p95 of 1.37 seconds, which is within the target. This is not a real-network or production-host measurement.
*NFR-USE-03 note:* checked down to 450 px only.
*NFR-REL-02 note:* `database_backup.py` makes consistent copies and a Windows scheduler installer exists. On macOS and Linux the team must schedule it. Uploaded photos are not backed up.
*NFR-MNT-02 note:* 76 automated tests exist and pass. The application is split into `app.py`, `campusshare_routes.py`, and `database.py`, but the routes remain in one file of about 3,700 lines.
*NFR-POR-01 note:* macOS was reported by the team, Windows is the development system, and the test suite passed on Linux.

## 4. Process flows

### 4.1 Request lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Pending: borrower submits request
    Pending --> Approved: owner approves
    Pending --> Rejected: owner rejects
    Approved --> Overdue: end date passes without return (automatic)
    Approved --> Completed: owner marks item returned
    Overdue --> Completed: owner marks item returned
    Rejected --> [*]
    Completed --> [*]
```

The code now refuses other changes (FR-REQ-08).

### 4.2 Main borrowing flow

        O->>S: Refund deposit
    end
    B->>S: Review the owner
    O->>S: Review the borrower
```

## 5. Verification and traceability

### 5.1 Automated tests

The branch contains 76 automated tests, which all passed in the reviewer's run on 2026-10-27 (Linux, Python 3.12). They run with `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` and use a temporary database. They cover registration and email verification, login lockout, sessions and cookies, CSRF, password rules, administrator actions, listing and rental validation, hourly and daily pricing, status transitions, late fees, payment, deposit and damage handling, disputes, ratings, notifications and email, return reminders, photo upload, database integrity, backups, and error pages.

### 5.2 Statuses confirmed without an automated test

## 6. Open issues for team decision

### 6.1 Decisions settled by the implementation

Hourly borrowing and the Administrator role are now in scope and built. Please confirm this is the intended scope.

### 6.2 Questions still open

| # | Question | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Should browsing stay public? | Visitors can open the browse page without logging in |

| 3 | How is a student ID verified, and against what source? | Email confirmation proves the email, not the student ID, one way is that students use Student ids as their email, so if email is verified and student ID matches, thats fine but there are some users that use a name or combination of characthers. how to vetify that. |
| 4 | Do Free items carry a late fee or deposit penalty? | The late fee is rate multiplied by days, which is zero for free items |
| 5 | Should a listing with one booking still show Booked for its free dates? | Now that several bookings are allowed, the label may mislead |
| 6 | Who sets up HTTPS, SMTP, and the schedulers for the demonstration? | SEC-12, FR-EXT-03, FR-NTF-04, and NFR-REL-02 depend on it |
| 7 | Should password-reset links be invalidated after use? | Closes the remaining part of SEC-11 |
| 8 | Which `Partial` and `To verify` items will be finished before Week 16? | Fixes the scope for the demonstration |

### Gaps found in the 2026-10-27 review of latest prototype

| ID | Observation | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| G-23 | Password-reset links are not invalidated after use | SEC-11, FR-AUTH-06 |
| G-24 | Email delivery through a real SMTP account has not been verified | FR-EXT-03, FR-NTF-05 |
| G-25 | Return reminders and database backups need a scheduler; scripts exist for Windows only | FR-NTF-04, NFR-REL-02 |
| G-26 | Uploaded photos are stored on local disk and are not backed up | FR-LST-07, NFR-REL-02 |
| G-27 | The unread message badge appears only on the dashboard page | FR-NTF-06 |
| G-28 | All route handlers are in one file of about 3,700 lines | NFR-MNT-02 |
| G-29 | The 360 px screen width has not been tested | NFR-USE-03 |
| G-30 | A listing shows Booked after one approved request, even when other dates are free | FR-LST-06 |
| G-31 | Required Improvements to the Equipment Borrowing System
1. Security Deposit Display
- The item description should display the required security deposit.
- The estimated rental cost should clearly state that the security deposit is not included in the rental fee.
2. Meetup and Physical Inspection
- Once a borrower requests an item, the system should prompt the borrower and owner to arrange a physical meetup.
- Both parties must meet and inspect the item before the rental is confirmed.
- The borrower should confirm whether they wish to proceed after inspecting the item.
3. Item Condition Documentation
- If the borrower agrees to proceed, they should be able to take and upload pictures of the item's current condition.
- These pictures will serve as evidence of the item's condition at the time of collection and can be compared against its condition upon return.
4. Rental Payment
- After documenting the item's condition, the borrower should proceed with the rental and payment.
- The system should clearly display the rental fee and security deposit separately.
5. Approval Workflow
- The current approval workflow needs to be revised.
- The owner should only approve the rental after the borrower has completed the required inspection, condition documentation, and payment.
- The system should not display the Mark as Returned option immediately after approval.
6. Rental Countdown and Return Tracking
- Introduce a timer or countdown based on the agreed borrowing period.
- The countdown should begin when the rental is confirmed and the item is handed over.
- The owner should be able to mark the item as returned once it has been physically returned.
7. Late Return and Penalties
- Introduce a late-return policy for items returned after the agreed deadline.
- The system should calculate late fees based on the duration of the delay and the applicable penalty rate.
- Notify the borrower when the return deadline is approaching or has passed.
8. Security Deposit Refund
- After the item is returned, the owner should inspect its condition.
- If the item is returned in good condition, the security deposit should be refunded to the borrower.
- If damage is identified, the system should support documenting the damage and determining any applicable deductions according to the agreed policy.
9. Hourly Rental Rates
- Introduce an hourly rental rate in addition to the existing rental pricing options.
- The system should calculate the rental cost based on the selected hourly or daily borrowing period. | request item and payment flow |
